CRISP - cross industry standard process for data mining -- used to solve any problem statement using ML models


5 steps:
- data ingestion
- exploratory data analysis
- data preparations / feature engineering
- model building
- model evaluation

EDA ... (we use it to gain insights from the data)
- profile of data ... no of cols/rows/datatype/duplicates
- statistical based analysis ... five point summary/outlier correction/covariance
-Graphical based analysis ... scatter plt/heatmap/boxplot/pairplt

once we understand the data well 
- we select relevant features
- convert into numerical values

EDA
1. univariate analysis
        - we analyze one feature at a time ( displot )
2. bivariate analysis
        - we analyze two features at a time ( scatter plot )
3. mulitvariate analysis
        - we analyze multiple features at a time ( heatmap/pairplot )
