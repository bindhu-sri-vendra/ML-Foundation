Model Training
    - In the given data estimate the prediction by minimizing the error

Model Overfitting
    - So here basically when the model is trained the accuracy will be high but when it tested on test data the accuracy will be low and that is called overfitting
    - Basically model performs well on train data and worst on test data

Model Underfitting
    -Here the model performs bad on both train and test data

Generalized Model
    -Accuracy will be high on both train and test data

Traning Error is also known as bias. higher the training error higher the bias
Testing Error is also known as variance. higher the testing error higher the variance

Missing data 
    reasons
        -human error 
        -data corruption
-------------------------------------------------------
a) missing completely at random:
    -the missing data is independent of the observed and unobserved data/other missing data.
eg: patient is suffering from a particular disease or not
patient | suffering
a1       | yes
a2       | no
a3       | yes
a4       | -
a5       | yes
a6       | -
from the above data the missing values are not dependent on other missing values as well as other present values of the same col
--------------------------------------------------------
b) missing at random
    -the missing data is dependent on observed data and not on unobserved data
--------------------------------------------------------
c)missing data not at random
    -the missing data will depend on the other missing values from the same column

Missing value treatment >>> should be asked from the business team ... not industry specified 
why? .... for data analysis and ML prediction it is important to handle missing values

1. If the dataset is huge and the missing values are <= 1% of the total data then we can just ignore them
2. replace the missing values with mean/median/mode 
    -if data is categorical replace with mode
    -if data is continous replace with mean/median
        -outlier treatment done ... replace with mean else median
3. if any of the col has missing values >= 40% then drop that column
4. replace the missing values with random values/ values that wont be possible to occur within that col (marks as -1)
