ML >> learns the patterns from data and tries to mimic them for future data 
EG: classifying an email spam or not

AI >> describes how computer and technology mimics human intelligence.
=>smart applications that perform tasks without human intervention
EG: self driving cars

note: ML is a subset of AI which main tasks is to learn patterns from data and make predictions.

DL >> is a subset of ML which contains algorithms that mimic human brain
EG: recommendation system/chatgpt

Types of ML styles
----------------------------
1.supervised learning 
2.unsupervised learning
3.semi supervised learning
4.reinforcement learning
----------------------------
1.supervised learning : y=f(x)
    whenever there is a dependent variable we can say it comes under supervised learning 
eg:
    area |  no of rooms  | price of the house(cr) ---> dependent variable(y)/target/outcome/labelled data
    1200 |  2            | 3 
    1400 |  4            | 5
    1300 |  3            | ?--> this will be predicted by the ML model  
we can predict the house rate based on area and no of rooms so house rate is dependent variable and area,no of rooms are independent variables / historic data(x)

supervised learning is of 2 types
a) Regression
    - here y is continous (any value on the number line)
      eg: price of the house (can be 3cr /3.5cr /3.76 cr)
b) Classification
    -here y is discrete (only the integers)
     eg: pass/fail 
    -If classification only takes 2 values then its called binary classification and over 3 values then multiclass classification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. unsupervised learning:
    - here there is no historic data (dependent / independent variables)
    - here we try to find similar groups in the data
eg: expenditure | salary(in lakhs)
    300000      | 35
    350000      | 37
    400000      | 45
    600000      | 55
here we try to find a pattern in the data 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.semi supervised learning
    -Its a combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning
    -It contains both labelled and unlabelled data
eg: consider any OTT 

netflix 
 first they will categorize customers into groups based on regions (unsupervised learning)
 second they will recommend any movies /shows based on the region (supervised learning)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Reinforcement learning
    - It is concerned with how intelligent agents take action in an environment to maximize the award

Eg: lets say we want to train our dog to move from point A to point B 

A __ biscuit ----------| biscuit -------------B
| \

here dog is the agent and the ground for A to B is our environment 
dog goes towards the biscuit which is a reward signal and all other ways have negative signal so by using reward signal A reaches B
