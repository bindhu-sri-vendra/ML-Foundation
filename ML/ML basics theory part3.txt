lets say we have a data where the dependent var/target var has only 2 outcomes
eg: diabetic or not
person | diabetic
a      | 0
b      | 1
c      | 0
d      | 0
e      | 1
f      | 0
here 0 means not diabetic and 1 means diabetic
if 90% of the data of target var is 0 and other 10% is 1 and it gives 90% accuracy even if dont use any ML model and thats a problem called class imbalace.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
class imbalance:
    - one class has higher percentage compared to other class
    - we dont want out data to learn only the majority pattern so we need to deal with class imbalance
    - we consider there is a class imbalance when its 80 -20/above 80- remaining stuff

Solutions to class imbalance
a) under sampling/down sampling
b) over sampling/up sampling
c) SMOTE
------------------------------------------------
a) under sampling/down sampling

lets say class A has 100 rows and class B has 900 rows.... we bring the size of class B to class A by selecting 100 random rows
disad:
    -loss of data
------------------------------------------------
a) over sampling/up sampling

lets say class A has 100 rows and class B has 900 rows.... we bring the size of class A to class B by repeating the class A to the size of class B(100x9)
disad:
    -no pattern cause data is just repeating continously
    -noise
------------------------------------------------
c) SMOTE -(synthetic minority over sampling technique)
How SMOTE Works:
Select a Minority Class Instance: SMOTE begins by randomly selecting a data point from the minority class.

Find K Nearest Neighbors:         It then identifies the k nearest neighbors of this selected instance, also from the minority class. The number k is a                                            configurable parameter.
Generate Synthetic Samples:       For each selected minority class instance, and for each of its k nearest neighbors, SMOTE generates new synthetic samples.                                        -This is done by:
                                        * Calculating the difference between the selected instance and one of its randomly chosen neighbors.
                                        * Multiplying this difference by a random number between 0 and 1. 
                                        * Adding the result to the original selected instance. This creates a new synthetic data point along the line segment                                              connecting the original point and its neighbor.

Repeat: This process is repeated until the desired balance between the minority and majority classes is achieved.

In industry we handle the class imbalance in the following way
lets say the classes are to the ratio 900 :100
we reduce the 900 to 600 using under sampling 
and then we increase the 100 to 400 using smote

600:400 is an acceptable balance between the classes
