Thread is the smallest unit of processing
By default the thread runs on a single processors
if we wanna run multiple threads at the same time then thats called multi threading
Multiple threads runs concurrently not parallaly --- that basically means only one thread executes at a particular instance of time 


MultiThreading
     1. since it happens under a single processor threads share memory space and resources within the process 
     2. concurrent
     3. it is best for applications that need to use same data or resources
     ex: downloading / managing multiple tabs on the browser

Multiprocessing
    1. since it happens with multiple processors each process has its own memory space and also resources are isolated from one another
    2. truly parallel
    3. it is best for tasks that can run independently
    ex: server handling multiple requests
